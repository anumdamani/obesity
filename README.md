# obesity

For this project, I used this dataset from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aravindpcoder/obesity-or-cvd-risk-classifyregressorcluster. I was interested in this research question: Is it possible to predict whether or not someone is obese using 15 predictors (including gender, age, weight, height, whether or not the person is a smoker, etc.)? I tried Logistic Regression and Decision Tree Classifier models. 

This repository includes the dataset, my code (.ipynb and .pdf), and a write-up that discusses my results.
